I am an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Louisville, where I head the HEAlthcare Robotics and Telesurgery (HEART) Laboratory . 
At the HeaRT lab, we work on the design, modeling, and control of surgical robots, especially miniature continuum (flexible) robotic tools. 

Prior to my faculty appointment, I was a Research Fellow in Cardiac Surgery at the Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, where I work with Dr. Pierre Dupont in the [Pediatric Cardiac Bioengineering Lab](http://robotics.tch.harvard.edu/main/index.php). In Summer 2021, I graduated with a Ph.D. from the [Medical Robotics and Automation Laboratory](https://robomed.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I worked on Robotic Guidewires and Neuro-endoscopes. I have been lucky to collaborate with experts at Georgia Tech in robotics, 
mechatronics, computer vision, modeling of mechanical systems, machine learning and haptics. I have also collaborated with interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons 
from the [Emory Winship Cancer Institute](https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/index.html) and the [Emory University Department of Neurosurgery](http://neurosurgery.emory.edu/).

### Lab Openings Announcement
I have ~~two openinings~~ for highly motivated Ph.D. students in my research team, the HEAlthcare Robotics and Telesurgery (HEART) Laboratory. 
If playing with state-of-the-art 3D Printers, laser cutters, Raspberry Pi's and NVIDIA Jetsons piques your interest, and you'd like to make a Ph.D. sized dent in the universe, we're looking for you!
