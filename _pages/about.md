I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Medical Robotics and Automation Laboratory](https://robomed.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
I am interested in the design, modeling, and control of surgical robots, especially miniature continuum (flexible) robotic tools. I have been lucky to collaborate with experts at Georgia Tech in robotics, 
mechatronics, computer vision, modeling of mechanical systems, machine learning and haptics. I also often collaborate with interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists and neurosurgeons 
from the [Emory Winship Cancer Institute](https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/index.html) and the [Emory University Department of Neurosurgery](http://neurosurgery.emory.edu/).

Before joining the lab, I also briefly worked on generating haptic datasets for [robotic hospital beds](http://pwp.gatech.edu/hrl/autobed-a-web-controlled-robotic-bed/) 
that can sense the pose of the occupant for collaborating with [PR2 robots](http://pwp.gatech.edu/hrl/wp-content/uploads/sites/231/2016/07/collaboration-robotic-bed.pdf). 
I have been fortunate to have worked on embedded system software at Lutron Electronics and designing control policies for UAVs and Ford vehicles at the University of Michigan.
