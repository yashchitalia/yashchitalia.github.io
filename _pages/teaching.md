#### <i>Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience, 2018-2019</i>
I have mentored two Petit Undergraduate Research Schloars in the years 2018-2019 and helped introduce medical robotics research to two very talented and capable young researchers.
In 2018, I helped my first scholar in the design and development of a simulated environment for the testing of the neuroendoscope tool in ROS and Unity. Her fellowship resulted in a conference paper submitted to IROS 2019, held in November 2019 in Macau China.

In 2019, this work was continued by the second Petit scholar (Mr. Kent Yamamoto, in the image above). Kent was responsible for designing a realistic phantom brain model from hydrogel and creating a simulated environment
for the testing of the robotic tool. He has also successfully created an electrocautery tool for the robot. Kent's prototype brain model is successfully able to replicate the elasticity of brain matter (E = 1.8 &plusmn; 0.5 kPa).
We successfully finished Kent's Petit mentorship with a submission to Transactions on Robotics journal.
