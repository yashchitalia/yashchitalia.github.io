The robotic pediatric neuroendoscope is a tendon-driven robotic tool with a handheld controller designed for minimally invasive surgeries for trating pediatric hydrocephalus. 
The tool itself is a cylindrical tube of 1.93 mm (outer diameter) that has two notch joints etched into it with a Femtosecond laser. 
Both joints of the robotic tool are in the same plane, allowing the robot to make S-shaped curves in any plane. 
The plane of bending can further be changed by a rolling motion capability in the handheld controller. The resulting tool is controlled using a joystick located at the back end of the handheld controller. 
Thus, the robotic tool and its controller are ergonomic in their design and fully compatible with existing endoscopes used in hydrocephalus cases.

In this project, we have designed and analyzed a 0.4 mm single degree-of-freedom and a 0.78 mm two degree-of-freedom robotic guidewire for cardiovascular applications. 
The guidewire makes use of a Femtosecond laser to etch notch joints into a Nitinol tube allowing it to bending in the plane of the notch joint with the application of a moment from a tendon.
